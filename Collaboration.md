## Contributions

### Preetham (Frontend & Design)

* Designed and finalized the **Figma prototypes** for the project, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
* Implemented the **frontend components** and connected them with the backend APIs for a seamless workflow.
* Worked on the **personalTasks module**, building the interface and ensuring smooth integration with the timer and task history.
* Contributed to **minor backend fixes** to resolve some integration issues between the frontend and backend.

### Lakshmidhar (Backend & System Design)

* Developed the **backend architecture**, handling data flow, API creation, and ensuring stability.
* Worked extensively on **connections and integrations** between services, enabling smooth communication between frontend and backend.
* Designed the **Low-Level Design (LLD)** for the system, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
* Implemented the **teamTasks module**, managing shared tasks, assignments, and collaboration flow.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Integration Issues** – During the early stages, the frontend and backend were not syncing properly, leading to API call failures.  
   * *Solution*: Frequent debugging sessions together helped trace mismatched request/response structures, and fixes were implemented on both ends.

2. **Time Management** – With multiple tasks (UI, backend, and system design) to handle in limited hackathon time, prioritization became a challenge.  
   * *Solution*: We divided responsibilities clearly, with Preetham focusing on UI/UX, frontend, and personalTasks, while Lakshmidhar took ownership of backend, LLD, and teamTasks. Minor cross-support ensured no bottlenecks.

3. **Version Control Conflicts** – While pushing frequent commits, we faced a few merge conflicts.  
   * *Solution*: Adopted proper **Git branching strategy** (feature branches and frequent merges) to minimize conflicts and ensure smooth collaboration.

## Key Takeaways

* Clear division of tasks (**personalTasks** and **teamTasks**) improved productivity and avoided overlaps.
* Continuous communication helped in solving blockers quickly.
* Collaboration between frontend and backend was crucial to deliver a complete and functional project within the hackathon timeframe.
